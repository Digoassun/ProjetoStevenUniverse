                <h1>Intro</h1>
                <p> The Crystal Gems are the remnants of an intergalactic army one day
                    led by Rose Quartz, Steven's mother. Their names are Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and, their youngest
                    member and still in
                    training,
                    Steven (being the only half-human member).<br> There are two key goals for the Crystal Gems, the
                    Earth protection against the Diamonds (dictators of the Gems' Homeworld) and Stevens' protection,
                    who lost his mother at birth, inheriting her gem. However, the boy proves himself many times being
                    able to help their experienced mentors and dealing with problems of
                    magnitudes much greater than he is aware of.</p>

                <p>
                    The game will take place inside each character's room. These rooms are magical,
                    having as entry access for all, a single door that contains the gems of Cystal Gems
                    carved into a star.<br>Each room aesthetically represents the personality of each of the characters.
                    However, everything changes when Rose's gem shines and
                    it make changes to the other rooms, creating different challenges that you, player, will help
                    our heroines to overcome.
